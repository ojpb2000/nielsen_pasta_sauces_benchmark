## Setup

1. Ensure you have Python 3.x installed
2. Install required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas
   ```

3. Run the data preparation script:
   ```bash
   python create_dashboard.py
   ```

4. **IMPORTANT**: Due to browser security restrictions (CORS), you cannot open `index.html` directly from the file system. You must use a local web server.

### Running Locally

**Option 1: Use the provided server script (Recommended)**
```bash
python server.py
```
This will automatically open your browser to `http://localhost:8000/index.html`

**Option 2: Use Python's built-in HTTP server**
```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```
Then manually open `http://localhost:8000/index.html` in your browser.

**Option 3: Deploy to GitHub Pages**
Upload the files to GitHub and enable GitHub Pages - this works without a local server.
